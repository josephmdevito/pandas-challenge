This is a repository for Module 4 Challenge, the written report for which is included below. 
In this challenge, I analyzed district-wide school data to infer conclusions based on the number of students at each school, the budget each school has to work with, the per student budget of each school, the average math and reading scores for each school, and the percent of students passing math/reading/both at each school. 
The dataset reveals to us that, contrary to what we might believe, each school's budget is not positively correlated with higher scores. We can decude this because the budgets of the highest performing schools did not differ much from the lowest performing schools. This is further backup up by the fact that some of the lowest performing schools had budgets that were relatively much higher than other schools.
The dataset also reveals to us that when compared to charter schools, district schools tend to score lower averages in both math and reading. This is further reinforced by the fact that district schools have lower average passing rates for math, reading, and combined math and reading when compared to charter schools. This could infer that charter schools perform better on average.
